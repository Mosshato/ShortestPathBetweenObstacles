# ShortestPathBetweenObstacles
This project represents my introduction in Computational Geometry.
This represents an optimized robot pathfinding combination of A* and TSP for small input data(N < 20).
I used the A* algorithm to calculate optimal routes by combining travel costs with heuristic estimates
and Bitmask dynamic programming to determine the optimal order of points of interest.
